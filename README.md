# Database Design, ETL, and Analytics of Chicago Crime Data: Unveiling Insights and Patterns

This project works through the Database Design, ETL and Analytics phases using a multi-year Chicago crime data source. his final project is divided into two parts. Part I fill focus on the database design and ETL. Part II will focus on the analytics.

### About the Data

This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Data Fulfillment and Analysis Division of the Chicago Police Department at DFA@ChicagoPolice.org

### Project in Parts

In Part 1:

* Reverse engineer an existing sourse RDBMS using metadata SQL queries to identify the table and attribute details necessary for creating tables and an entity-relationship 
   diagram depecting the database logical structure. The source data is an SQLite database.
* Implement a set of tables using DDL in your SSO dsa_student database schema on the postgres server that replicates the source database structure.
* Create an Entity Relationship Diagram.
* Establish connections to the source and destination databases.
* Extract the source data from tables, Transform values as required and Load into the destination tables.
* Validate the ETL process by confirming row counts in both source and destination tables.

In Part 2:

* Query Design and Execution
* Analytics and Insights
